;Palette Name: Mega Drive Blue
;Description: A palette built and developed from the very title screen of Sonic 3, focused on emulating vibrant colors and an abundant use of black found in Mega Drive/Genesis games that somehow contrast with the SNES's more pastel tones. Note that this palette is in constant development, so expect an update somewhere in the future. (Note: this is not specifically a system palette, only inspired by it)
